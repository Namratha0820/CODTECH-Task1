Overview of the Project

Task Overview: 
"Sentiment Analysis Using NLP"
   I have build a simple sentiment analysis model using Python with the help of the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and scikit-learn libraries. 
   Sentiment analysis classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral categories.

How the Code Works:
   NLTK Movie Reviews Corpus: 
      We use the movie_reviews dataset from NLTK for a labeled text corpus of positive and negative movie reviews.
  Text Preprocessing:
      The CountVectorizer converts text into a bag-of-words representation.
  Naive Bayes Classifier:
      We use the MultinomialNB model, which is suitable for text classification.
  Evaluation: 
      The code evaluates the model’s performance using accuracy and a classification report. 
  Sentiment Analysis:
      This is one of the most popular NLP applications, used to analyze customer feedback, social media sentiment, etc.
  Text Classification:
      Involves assigning categories to text, used in spam detection, topic classification, and more.
  Future Enhancements:
      Consider using more advanced models like TF-IDF Vectorizer or deep learning models using TensorFlow or PyTorch for better accuracy.
  Pre-trained Models:
      Use models like BERT or GPT for more sophisticated NLP tasks, as they often outperform traditional ML models.
